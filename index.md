title: What If?
---



**What if** each time you come across garbage on the internet, instead of hitting a feeble back button you could click a garbage can and vanquish the junk from *your* web forever?

What if this single click were powerful enough to...

- train your browser to detect and flag links to garbage on all pages and search results?
- spread a warning to the browsers of other people so they can avoid the same garbage?
- make websites pushing garbage lose traffic and lose profits?
- turn your frustration into satisfaction?

What if another single click turns it all off, any time you wanted to see the web unfiltered?  

What if everyone's garbage can clicks combined to turn the tables on click bait, scams, false advertising and all other dishonest or poor content? What if the system were smart enough to only share warnings among people who agreed on what was garbage? What if the system were un-gameable, and any dishonest attempt to sink something always backfired?    

What if the web were not what advertisers made of it, but *what we made of it?*  What if the web were the home of healthy discourse and information you could trust? 

I'm dead serious. 

**We can** take down bad actors and clean up the web. We can’t outlaw manipulative and exploitive advertising, but we can make it irrelevant, or even better, backfire. We can take back the web.

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. I’m working on it, and it's called **Common Karma**. Check back here, but it might be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org).
