# What if the web had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you get garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A product review written by a shill. More viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. A scam you know hurts many innocent people. Or something just poorly written or plain wrong. 

All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. 

You were just had. And they just made money. This is how the web works today. 

More junk from the same perp keeps reappearing in your search results, social media feeds, and regular browsing. You can't make it go away. You wish you could warn other people: *"Don't go there. Trust me. It's garbage."*

What if your browser had a <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> button? You press it and the page you're on is marked as garbage and thrown out. Your browser learns from each mark, automatically detecting and crossing out <del>links to other garbage</del>. Marks are shared across millions of users, and soon most garbage on the web is marked. You no longer have to wade through ten <del>bad things</del> to find one good one. Producers of <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del>, <del>fake news</del> and <del>junk</del> are punished with lost traffic and dwindling profits. They go out of business, reducing web garbage ever further.

How can this work if people disagree on what is garbage? If we  share marks only between people with similar standards of truth and utility, how do we avoid separating everyone into bubbles of conforming tastes and opinions? I believe I have the solution, a solution that has an incredibly valuable side-effect: the web becomes inherently *un-gameable*. 

Imagine a web where dishonesty always backfires. Where what goes around *always* comes around. A web with accountability. A web with **karma**. 

Healthy discourse would have a chance. Trust would trounce <del>lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
