# What if your web browser had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good stuff. Instead, you find garbage. An ad masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A stupid list of ten stupid things on ten separate pages so they can show you ten times the ads. A "review" that was clearly paid for. Or worst of all, an outright evil scam that doesn't fool you but you know fools many many innocent people. All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. Maybe fume a little.

What if instead you could click <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> and throw the <del>garbage</del> out of *your* web *forever*? What if this same single click

- trained your browser to detect and cross out <del>links to garbage</del>?
- spread a warning to other people's browsers so they could avoid <del>the same garbage<del>?
- punished <del>websites pushing garbage</del> with lost traffic and lost profits?

Would it give you a warm sense of satisfaction? 

What if this worked not just for outright junk, but <del>low quality stuff</del> too? Everyone and their mother has a <del>web page claiming the best way to boil an egg</del>. Or who to vote for. Maybe 1 out of 10 of them are good. Can you imagine not wading through ten <del>pieces of junk</del> to find one good thing?

Of course one person's garbage is another person's treasure. The system has to be smart enough to only share warnings among people who agreed on what is garbage and what isn't. It has to be done in a way that doesn't separate people into islands of conforming tastes and opinions, that keeps them exposed to challenging ideas. This is the most difficult piece of the puzzle, but when it is solved, another beautiful thing emerges: It will be inherently un-gameable. Dishonesty would always backfire. No loopholes. No tricks. What goes around would *always* came around. A web with **karma**. 

Everyone's combined <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> clicks would turn the tables on <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del> and all other <del>dishonest junk</del>.  <del>Second-rate stuff</del> would fizzle. Healthy discourse would have a chance. Information you could trust would finally start to outnumber <del>the lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
