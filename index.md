title: What If?
---



**What if** when you come across garbage on the internet, instead of hitting a feeble back button you could click a garbage can and vanquish the junk from *your* web forever?

What if that single click were powerful enough to...

- train your browser to detect and flag garbage links on all pages and search results?
- send a warning to the browsers of other people, helping them avoid the same garbage?
- make websites pushing garbage lose traffic and lose profits?
- turn your frustration into satisfaction?

What if another single click turned it all off, just in case you wanted to see the web in all it filthy glory?  

What if this system were un-gameable, so that no one could abuse this power to sink anything just because they disagreed with it, were competing with it, or just didn't get it? What if any abuse of this power always backfired?

What if click bait, scams, popups and privacy invasions no longer ruled the web? What if the web was not what advertisers made of it, but *what we made of it?* What if the web was the home of healthy discourse and information you could trust? 

I'm dead serious. 

**We can** take down bad actors and clean up the web. We can’t outlaw manipulative and exploitive advertising, but we can make it irrelevant, or even better, we can make it backfire. We can take back the web.

This sounds radically ambitious. It has to be. I’m working on a way. Check back here, but it might be a while. [Drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org).
