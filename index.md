title: What If?

What if your web browser had a trash can? 

What if, instead of the cowardly back button, you could click this trash can whenever a link led you to garbage, vanquishing it from *your* web forever?

What if this single click were powerful enough to...

- train your browser to detect and flag links to garbage before you even clicked them?
- spread a warning to the browsers of other people so they could avoid the same garbage?
- punish websites pushing garbage with lost traffic and lost profit?
- turn frustration into satisfaction?

What if another click turned it all off, any time you wanted to see the web unfiltered?  

What if everyone's garbage can clicks combined to turn the tables on click bait, scams, false advertising and all other dishonest or junk content? What if the system were smart enough to only share warnings among people who agreed on what was garbage? What if the system were un-gameable, and any dishonest attempt to sink anything always backfired?

What if the web were not what advertisers made of it, but *what we made of it?*  What if the web were the home of healthy discourse and information you could trust? 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. 

We can clean up the web. 

We can take down bad actors. 

We can make the web ours again. 

Just imagine. 

Iâ€™m working on a project that might get us there. I call it **Common Karma**. Check back here, but it might be a long while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org).
