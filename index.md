title: What If?

**What if** when you come across garbage on the internet, instead of hitting the back button in angry disgust, you could gleefully click on a garbage can button? Imagine that single click would...

- vanquish that page from *your* web forever, or everything from that source if you choose.
- send a warning to the browsers of like-minded people, helping them avoid the same garbage. 
- make websites pushing garbage pay. Instead of letting them get away with web murder and boatloads of ad money, they lose traffic and lose profits.
- turn frustration into a calm sense of satisfaction.

What if another single click turned it all off, just in case you wanted to see the web in all it filthy glory?  

What if click bait, scams, popups and privacy invasions no longer ruled the web? What if the web was not what advertisers made of it, but *what we made of it?* What if the web was the home of healthy discourse and information you could trust? 

Yes, I'm dead serious. 

**We can** take down bad actors and clean up the web. We can’t outlaw manipulative and exploitive advertising, but we can make it irrelevant, or even better, we can make it backfire. We can take back the web.

This sounds radically ambitious. It has to be. I’m working on a way. Check back here, but it might be a while. [Drop me a line](mailto:vas@commonkarma.org).
