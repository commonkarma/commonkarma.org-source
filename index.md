# What if your web browser had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you find garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A product review written by a shill. Some viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. An scam that doesn't fool you but likely hurts many innocent people. All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. Maybe fume a little.

What if you could click <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> and throw the <del>garbage</del> out of *your* web *forever*? What if this same single click

- trained your browser to detect and cross out <del>links to garbage</del>?
- spread a warning to other people's browsers so they could avoid <del>the same crap<del>?
- punished <del>websites pushing junk</del> with lost traffic and lost profits?

Outright garbage booted. Now what about <del>lesser junk</del>? For nearly every topic, from boiling an egg to which politician should be trusted, there are dozens or hundreds of articles. Maybe 1 out of 10 are worth your time. Imagine not wading through ten <del>pieces of junk</del> to find a single good one.

Of course one person's garbage is another person's treasure. The system has to be smart enough to only share warnings among people who agreed on what is garbage and what isn't. It has to be done in a way that doesn't separate people into islands of conforming tastes and opinions, that keeps them exposed to challenging ideas. This is a very difficult problem, but when solved another beautiful thing emerges: an inherently un-gameable web. Dishonesty would always backfire. No loopholes. No tricks. What goes around would *always* came around. A web with **karma**. 

Everyone's combined <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> clicks would turn the tables on <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del> and all other <del>dishonest junk</del>.  <del>Second-rate stuff</del> would fizzle. Healthy discourse would have a chance. Information you could trust would finally start to outnumber <del>the lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
