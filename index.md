# What if your web had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you get garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A product review written by a shill. More viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. A scam that you know fools many innocent people.

All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. Fume.

The same junk keeps reappearing in your search results, social media feeds, and regular browsing. You can't make it go away. You can't flag the page for everyone else to see: *Don't go there. Trust me. It's garbage.*

What if you had a <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> button. You press it and

- that <del>garbage</del> is deleted and you never see it again,
- your browser learns to detect and cross out <del>links to other garbage</del>,
- warnings are shared so other people can avoid <del>the same crap<del>,
- and <del>websites pushing junk</del> are punished with lost traffic and lost profits.

This works with <del>lesser junk</del> too. For nearly every topic, from boiling an egg to which politician should be trusted, there are dozens or hundreds of articles. Maybe 1 out of 10 are worth your time. Imagine not wading through ten <del>pieces of junk</del> to find a single good one.

Of course one person's garbage is another's treasure. The system must be smart enough to share warnings only among people who have the same sense of truth, quality and value. But it has to be done in a way that doesn't separate people into islands of conforming tastes and opinions, that keeps them exposed to challenging ideas. 

If these seemingly contradictory goals can be achieved together another beautiful thing emerges: an inherently un-gameable web. A web where dishonesty always backfires, with no loopholes or tricks. What goes around would *always* came around. Imagine a web with accountability. Everyone's combined <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> clicks turning the tables on <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del>, <del>fake news</del>  and other <del>dishonesty</del>. <del>Low quality stuff</del> gets scrubbed too. A web with **karma**. 

Healthy discourse would have a chance. Trustworthy information would beat <del>lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
