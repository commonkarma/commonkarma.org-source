# What if your web browser had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you find garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A product review written by a shill. More viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. An scam that doesn't fool you but likely hurts many innocent people. 

All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. Fume a little.

What if you could simply click <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> to toss out <del>garbage</del> forever? What if the same single click:

- trained your browser to detect and cross out <del>links to garbage</del>?
- spread a warning to other people's browsers so they could avoid <del>the same crap<del>?
- punished <del>websites pushing junk</del> with lost traffic and lost profits?

Outright garbage booted. Now what about <del>lesser junk</del>? For nearly every topic, from boiling an egg to which politician should be trusted, there are dozens or hundreds of articles. Maybe 1 out of 10 are worth your time. Imagine not wading through ten <del>pieces of junk</del> to find a single good one.

Of course one person's garbage is another's treasure. The system must be smart enough to share warnings only among people who have the same sense of truth, quality and value. But it has to be done in a way that doesn't separate people into islands of conforming tastes and opinions, that keeps them exposed to challenging ideas. If these seemingly contradictory goals can be achieved together (I believe I know how) another beautiful thing emerges: an inherently un-gameable web. Dishonesty would always backfire. No loopholes. No tricks. What goes around would *always* came around. A web with accountability. A web with **karma**. 

Everyone's combined <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> clicks would turn the tables on <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del>, <del>fake news</del>  and other <del>dishonesty</del>. <del>Low quality stuff</del> would fizzle. Healthy discourse would have a chance. Trustworthy information would beat <del>lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
