# What if your web had a trash can?

You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you get garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don't need. A product review written by a shill. More viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. A scam you know hurts many innocent people.

All you can do is press the back button. Retreat. Fume.

More junk from the same perp keeps reappearing in your search results, social media feeds, and regular browsing. You can't make it go away. You wish you could warn other people: *"Don't go there. Trust me. It's garbage."*

What if you had a <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> button? By pressing it you toss the <del>garbage</del>, never to see it again. You teach your browser to detect and cross out <del>links to other garbage</del>. Warnings are spread so other people avoid <del>the same crap</del>, punishing <del>websites pushing junk</del> with lost traffic and lost profits.

Over time as your browser learns, you see less and less junk. This works not just for the malicious stuff, but also the <del>lesser junk</del> that isn't worth your time. You no longer have to wade through ten <del>bad things</del> to find a single good one.

Since one person's garbage can be another's treasure, the system must be smart enough to share warnings only among people who have the same sense of truth, quality and value. But it has to be done in a way that doesn't separate people into islands of conforming tastes and opinions, that keeps them exposed to challenging ideas. If these seemingly contradictory goals can be achieved together another beautiful thing emerges: an inherently un-gameable web. 

Imagine everyone's combined <span class="garbage-can">![a trash can](./images/garbage-can.svg)</span> clicks turning the tables on <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del>, <del>fake news</del>  and <del>low quality litter</del>. Imagine a web where dishonesty always backfires. No loopholes. What goes around would *always* came around. A web with accountability. A web with **karma**. 

Healthy discourse would have a chance. Trustworthy information would beat <del>lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again. 

If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be. We need this. 

I'm working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to [drop me a line](mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org). Especially if you want to help.
